(1) There are about 30 lines, the loop will run until x is less than the width-10 

(2) The first 10 in the code defines the variable x and tells us where the first line will be drawn on the canvas, the second determines where the line will stop being drawn, and the third adds another line, making sure they don't overlap


(1) The loop runs every frame. When the x and y arrays are full they still run every frame

(2) Changing the i= i + (a number) is one way to increase the space between rings. Another is to change (x.length-i), changing it to a number makes the circles overlap. 

How can you make the ellipse trail longer?

(3) You can make the ellipse trail longer by adding more circles to the code, x.slice(100) and y.slice(100) adds more and creates a bigger trail
